# GTAdhocCompiler
Work in progress compiler for the Gran Turismo scripting language, Adhoc, from C#.

Adhoc is a scripting language similar to javascript with a few additions of its own. 

A fork of [esprima-dotnet](https://github.com/Nenkai/esprima-dotnet) is used to lex and parse the Adhoc code into an abstract syntax tree prior to compiling.
